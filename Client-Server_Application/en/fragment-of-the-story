Description of the subject area on which the object model is to be built:

I managed to elicit from Denfort that the last terrible visual impression was in the form of a mirage.
According to him, it had nothing to do with the cubic structures on the slopes, nor with the singing
exuding steam caves Ridges of Madness. A devilish vision that flashed through the clouds opened
to him, that they hide the purple mountains, which the Elders were so afraid of and which the Elders dared not approach.
Perhaps the vision was a half hallucination, quite likely after we had suffered
of tests, and by half - with the mirage that he did not recognize, which we had already contemplated, flying up in the afternoon
back to the lake camp. But whatever it was, it deprived Denfort of rest until the end of his days. Sometimes with
his lips break incoherent, meaningless phrases like: "black abyss", "carved edges",
"proto-hugs", "five-dimensional, tightly closed constructions", "vile cylinder", "ancient Pharos",
"Yog-Sotot", "the original white jelly-like structure", "cosmic shade", "wings", "eyes in the dark",
"Moonlight", "primeval, eternal, undying" and other strange phrases. Having recovered,
he doesnâ€™t really explain anything, associating his dark remarks with immoderate reading in his youth
dangerous esoteric literature. Denfort, one of the few, dared to read to the end
time the "Necronomicon", which was kept under lock and key in the library of the university. I remember when we
flew over the Splinters of Madness, the sky was frowning, and although I never looked up, I think that
snow whirlwinds took fantastic outlines there. Quickly running clouds could enhance, supplement and
even distort the picture, the imagination - to easily paint it even more, and by the time
For the first time, Denfort gave a hint about his nightmarish vision; he also managed to acquire allusions from his old
reading. He could not see so much in an instant.
